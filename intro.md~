# Introduction to the Mclaren Synth Kit

The McLaren Synth Kit aims to bring audio programming to Objective-C on Linux.  It consists of two parts.

1) Alsa Sound Kit (ASK) - simple Obj-C wrappers around Alsa sound and MIDI devices
2) Mclaren Synth Kit (MSK) - a more abstract sound "context" and synthesizer construction operators like oscillators, envelopes and effects.
