## Introduction

The McLaren Synth Kit is a project and a library.  The project you see here contains demonstration programs, header files and libraries that you can use for learning or for your own projects.

McLaren Synth Kit provides Objective-C interfaces to the ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) MIDI and Sound devices on Linux computers.  McLaren Synth Kit works with GNUstep and [libdispatch](https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-libdispatch) for a thoroughly modern, multicore experience.
